# Tornadoes-Prediction-and-Impact-Analysis

Extensive analysis of the U.S. Tornadoes data - 1950 to 2016 (Data source : https://www.kaggle.com/jtennis/spctornado) was carried out using the statistical data analysis methodologies to arrive at the following results
1.Performed two sample one tailed hypothesis testing to confirm that  the tornadoes of magnitude 3 travel a longer distance compared to the tornadoes of magnitude 4
2.Performed two sample two tailed hypothesis testing to confirm that the number of people injured by tornadoes in states Texas and Alabama are not the same and that they are different
3.Performed one sample two tailed hypothesis testing to confirm that the average number of fatalities caused by tornadoes is 4
4.Performed one sample one tailed hypothesis testing to confirm that the no of states affected by tornado of magnitudes 0 to 3 are less than 3
5.Built an ANOVA model to compare the property losses of different regions and found that the average loss incurred across various regions are not the same. 
6.Built an ANOVA model to compare the injuries caused by tornadoes of different magnitude and found that the average no. of injuries due to tornadoes of different magnitude categories are not the same. 
7.Used KNN classification technique to classify the magnitude category from length, width and distance traveled by a tornado, but this classification model did not yield a better accuracy and hence confirmed that we cannot deduce magnitude category of tornado accurately based on length, width and distance traveled by tornadoes.
8.Used Naive Bayes classification method to classify the property loss category from magnitude category , region and no. of states affected by a tornado. Accuracy was very low and hence confirmed that we cannot deduce property loss category accurately based on magnitude category, region and number of states affected by tornadoes.
9.Performed time series analysis to forecast the length of tornadoes that would occur in future.
